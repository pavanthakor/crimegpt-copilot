# Ground-truth verification worksheet -- section-mapping eval

**Purpose.** This file lays each complaint beside (a) the BNS section the eval *expects* and (b) the section the model actually *returned*, each with its **full statutory text pulled verbatim from `data/bns_bnss_bsa/BNS.txt`**, so a human can decide -- quickly and on the record -- whether the expected section or the model was right. It is the evidence behind the accuracy number.

**This worksheet decides nothing.** No `expected_sections` value and no `verified` flag has been changed. Choosing the correct BNS section is a legal judgement reserved to the user. Fill in the **Your call** line under each case; corrections get applied in a later pass.

## Provenance & integrity

- Eval commit: **7602a28**, pushed to branch **`origin/eval/section-mapping`** (not merged to main).
- Baseline (3 runs/case, live `qwen2.5:7b`): top-1 **47%**, recall **39%**, precision **44%**, stability **83%**, out-of-scope refusal **100%**.
- Cases: **21** = 19 in-scope + 2 out-of-scope. Category counts match the build request; `_meta.count_note` records the 20-vs-21 discrepancy.
- **Every expected section code exists in `BNS.txt`** (integrity check passed -- no phantom sections).
- Model per-run selections read from `section_eval_results.json`; statutory text sliced from `BNS.txt` (header `NNN.` to next higher-numbered header, illustrations/explanations included).

## 1. Suspected GROUND-TRUTH errors -- review these first

Each of the following was flagged as a likely **ground-truth** problem (the eval, not the model) or a genuine close call. Read these before the rest.

> **Flag 1 -- `mischief-01-crop-fire`.** Facts are crop-burning by **fire**. Expected **324** (general mischief); model returned **326**. BNS 326 is *mischief by ... fire*. If 326 is the more specific offence, the ground truth (324) may be the error, not the model.

> **Flag 2 -- `hurt-01-simple`.** Expected **115** (voluntarily causing hurt, *simple*); model returned **117** (voluntarily causing *grievous* hurt). Turns on whether a bleeding nose + cut lip is *hurt* or *grievous hurt* (BNS 116 defines grievous hurt). This single call flips the headline top-1 either way.

> **Flag 3 -- `cbt-01-money`.** Expected **316** (criminal breach of trust -- requires **entrustment**); model returned **315** (misappropriation of a *deceased person's* property). Was the money *entrusted* 'to keep safely'? If so the model's 315 looks genuinely wrong.

> **Flag 4 -- `cbt-02-goods`.** Expected **316** (breach of trust -- **entrustment**); model returned **314** (plain dishonest misappropriation, no entrustment element). Gold was handed to a goldsmith *to make jewellery*. Entrustment (316) vs bare misappropriation (314) is the question.

> **Flag 5 -- `trespass-01-house-trespass`.** Expected **329** (base criminal/house-trespass); model returned **330** (house-breaking / *lurking* trespass with concealment) + **333**. Does the complaint actually describe **hiding/concealment or breaking**, or just unauthorised entry?

### `mischief-01-crop-fire` -- mischief

**Complaint (the facts):**

> Because of an old enmity over a boundary, my neighbour deliberately went into my field at night and set fire to my haystack and standing wheat crop. A large part of my crop, worth about eighty thousand rupees, was completely burnt and destroyed. He did it only to cause me loss.

loss or damage to the public or to any person, causes the destruction of any property, or any
such change in any property or in the situation thereof as destroys or diminishes its value or
utility, or affects it injuriously, commits mischief.
Explanation 1.—It is not essential to the offence of mischief that the offender should
intend to cause loss or damage to the owner of the property injured or destroyed. It is
sufficient if he intends to cause, or knows that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage
to any person by injuring any property, whether it belongs to that person or not.
Explanation 2.—Mischief may be committed by an act affecting property belonging
to the person who commits the act, or to that person and others jointly.

(g) A, having joint property with Z in a horse, shoots the horse, intending thereby to
cause wrongful loss to Z. A has committed mischief.
(h) A causes cattle to enter upon a field belonging to Z, intending to cause and
knowing that he is likely to cause damage to Z’s crop. A has committed mischief.
(2) Whoever commits mischief shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.

```
115. (1) Whoever does any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any
person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person, and does
thereby cause hurt to any person, is said “voluntarily to cause hurt”.
(2) Whoever, except in the case provided for by sub-section (1) of section 122 voluntarily
causes hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

```
117. (1) Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or
knows himself to be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is
grievous hurt, is said “voluntarily to cause grievous hurt”.
Explanation.—A person is not said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt except when he
both causes grievous hurt and intends or knows himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt.
But he is said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt, if intending or knowing himself to be likely
to cause grievous hurt of one kind, he actually causes grievous hurt of another kind.
Illustration.
A, intending of knowing himself to be likely permanently to disfigure Z’s face, gives
Z a blow which does not permanently disfigure Z’s face, but which causes Z to suffer severe
bodily pain for the space of fifteen days. A has voluntarily caused grievous hurt.

causes grievous hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.

commission causes any hurt to a person which causes that person to be in permanent
disability or in persistent vegetative state, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for
a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life,
which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s natural life.
(4) When a group of five or more persons acting in concert, causes grievous hurt to a
person on the ground of his race, caste or community, sex, place of birth, language, personal
belief or any other similar ground, each member of such group shall be guilty of the offence
of causing grievous hurt, and shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for
a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.

over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or
dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing
the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied,
which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person
so to do, commits criminal breach of trust.
Explanation 1.—A person, being an employer of an establishment whether
exempted under section 17 of the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous
Provisions Act, 1952 or not who deducts the employee’s contribution from the wages payable
to the employee for credit to a Provident Fund or Family Pension Fund established by any
law for the time being in force, shall be deemed to have been entrusted with the amount of the

to the said Fund in violation of the said law, shall be deemed to have dishonestly used the
amount of the said contribution in violation of a direction of law as aforesaid.
Explanation 2.—A person, being an employer, who deducts the employees’
contribution from the wages payable to the employee for credit to the Employees’ State
Insurance Fund held and administered by the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation
established under the Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948 shall be deemed to have been
entrusted with the amount of the contribution so deducted by him and if he makes default in
the payment of such contribution to the said Fund in violation of the said Act, shall be
deemed to have dishonestly used the amount of the said contribution in violation of a
direction of law as aforesaid.

more for Z’s advantage to hold shares in the Bank of Bengal, disobeys Z’s directions, and
buys shares in the Bank of Bengal, for Z, instead of buying Company’s paper, here,
though Z should suffer loss, and should be entitled to bring a civil action against A, on

314. Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any movable
property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not
be less than six months but which may extend to two years and with fine.
Illustrations.
(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z’s possession, in good faith believing at
the time when he takes it, that the property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if
A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is
guilty of an offence under this section.
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes
away a book without Z’s express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z’s
implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But,
if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse. A takes the horse out of B’s possession,
intending to use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly
misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own
use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation
within the meaning of this section.
Illustration.
A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement.
A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan,
intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this section.
Explanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other
person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the
owner, does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he
is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or
has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover
and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner
to claim it.
What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question
of fact.
It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that
any particular person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he
does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot
be found.
Illustrations.
(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs, A picks
up the rupee. Here A has not committed the offence defined in this section.
(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank-note. From the direction and contents
of the letter he learns to whom the note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an
offence under this section.
(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who
has lost the cheque. But the name of the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A
knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque was drawn.
A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an
offence under this section.
(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of
restoring it to Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence
under this section.
(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers
that it belongs to Z, and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this
section.
(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately
without attempting to discover the owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section.

**BNS 303 -- Theft**  _EXPECTED_

```
303. (1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the
possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to
such taking, is said to commit theft.
Explanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable
property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as
soon as it is severed from the earth.
Explanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may
be a theft.
Explanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle
which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by
actually moving it.
Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to
move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused,
is moved by that animal.
Explanation 5.—The consent mentioned in this section may be express or implied,
and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that
purpose authority either express or implied.
Illustrations.
(a) A cuts down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree
out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order
to such taking, he has committed theft.
(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, if
A’s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. A
has committed theft as soon as Z’s dog has begun to follow A.
(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain
direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins
to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.
(d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs
away with the plate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft.
(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall
return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession.
It could not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though
he may have committed criminal breach of trust.
(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring
is in Z’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.
(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by
taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.
(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to
misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a
place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking
the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of
first moving the ring, commits theft.
(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not
owing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a
security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away.
Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed
theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.
(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as
a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of
depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes
it dishonestly.
(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without
Z’s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the
watch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.
(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with
the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here
A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.
(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes
away a book without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the
intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s
implied consent to use Z’s book. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.
(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows
to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised
to give away alms. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.
(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to
belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If
A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.
(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes
that property out of Z’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not
commit theft.
(2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second
or subsequent conviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with
rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend
to five years and with fine:
Provided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five
thousand rupees, and a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value
of property or restoration of the stolen property, shall be punished with community service.

318. (1) Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the
person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person
shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do
anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or
omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation
or property, is said to cheat.
Explanation.—A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of
this section.
Illustrations.
(a) A, by falsely pretending to be in the Civil Service, intentionally deceives Z, and
thus dishonestly induces Z to let him have on credit goods for which he does not mean to
pay. A cheats.
(b) A, by putting a counterfeit mark on an article, intentionally deceives Z into a
belief that this article was made by a certain celebrated manufacturer, and thus dishonestly
induces Z to buy and pay for the article. A cheats.

believing that the article corresponds with the sample, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to
buy and pay for the article. A cheats.

money, and by which A expects that the bill will be dishonoured, intentionally deceives Z,
and thereby dishonestly induces Z to deliver the article, intending not to pay for it. A cheats.
(e) A, by pledging as diamonds articles which he knows are not diamonds, intentionally
deceives Z, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to lend money. A cheats.
(f) A intentionally deceives Z into a belief that A means to repay any money that Z
may lend to him and thereby dishonestly induces Z to lend him money, A not intending to
repay it. A cheats.
(g) A intentionally deceives Z into a belief that A means to deliver to Z a certain
quantity of indigo plant which he does not intend to deliver, and thereby dishonestly induces
Z to advance money upon the faith of such delivery. A cheats; but if A, at the time of
obtaining the money, intends to deliver the indigo plant, and afterwards breaks his contract
and does not deliver it, he does not cheat, but is liable only to a civil action for breach of
contract.
(h) A intentionally deceives Z into a belief that A has performed A’s part of a contract
made with Z, which he has not performed, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to pay money.
A cheats.
(i) A sells and conveys an estate to B. A, knowing that in consequence of such sale
he has no right to the property, sells or mortgages the same to Z, without disclosing the fact
of the previous sale and conveyance to B, and receives the purchase or mortgage money
from Z. A cheats.
(2) Whoever cheats shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.
(3) Whoever cheats with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause wrongful
loss to a person whose interest in the transaction to which the cheating relates, he was
bound, either by law, or by a legal contract, to protect, shall be punished with imprisonment
of either description for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both.

**BNS 335 -- Making a false document**  _MODEL -- not in expected_

```
335. A person is said to make a false document or false electronic record—
(A) Who dishonestly or fraudulently—
(i) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document;
(ii) makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic
record;
(iii) affixes any electronic signature on any electronic record;
(iv) makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the
authenticity of the electronic signature,
with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of
document, electronic record or electronic signature was made, signed, sealed,
executed, transmitted or affixed by or by the authority of a person by whom or
by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, executed or
affixed; or
(B) Who without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation
or otherwise, alters a document or an electronic record in any material part thereof,
after it has been made, executed or affixed with electronic signature either by himself or
by any other person, whether such person be living or dead at the time of such
alteration; or
(C) Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or
alter a document or an electronic record or to affix his electronic signature on any
electronic record knowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or
intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception practised upon him, he does not
know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature of the alteration.
Illustrations.
(a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud
B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by
B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.
(b) A, without Z’s authority, affixes Z’s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance
of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining
from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery.
(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any
sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the
sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.
(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed byA, without inserting the
sum payable and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten
thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the
cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.
(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority,
intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its
maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to
suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.
(f) Z’s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally
divided between A, B and C”. A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending that it may be
believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.
(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order
by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B
dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special
endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.
(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate,
executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the
conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he
conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.
(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the
legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his
instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.
(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B’s name without B’s authority, certifying that A is
a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune,
intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made
a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.
(k) A without B’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B’s name certifying to A’s
character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as
much as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter
into an express or implied contract for service.
Explanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.
Illustrations.
(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that
the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.
(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z’s name, in
order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and
negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B,
knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of
forgery.
(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same
name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was
endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.
(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the
seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent
and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to
defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B,
though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.
(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A’s benefit, and
with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a
promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the
note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of
insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition.
Explanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person,
intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a
deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in
his lifetime, may amount to forgery.
Illustration.
A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in
the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.
Explanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing electronic
signature” shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2
of the Information Technology Act, 2000.

Of cheating
```

_Sections the model chose that differ from the expected set:_

**BNS 314 -- Dishonest misappropriation of property**  _MODEL -- not in expected_

```
314. Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any movable
property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not
be less than six months but which may extend to two years and with fine.
Illustrations.
(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z’s possession, in good faith believing at
the time when he takes it, that the property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if
A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is
guilty of an offence under this section.
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes
away a book without Z’s express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z’s
implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But,
if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse. A takes the horse out of B’s possession,
intending to use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly
misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own
use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation
within the meaning of this section.
Illustration.
A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement.
A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan,
intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this section.
Explanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other
person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the
owner, does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he
is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or
has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover
and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner
to claim it.
What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question
of fact.
It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that
any particular person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he
does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot
be found.
Illustrations.
(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs, A picks
up the rupee. Here A has not committed the offence defined in this section.
(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank-note. From the direction and contents
of the letter he learns to whom the note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an
offence under this section.
(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who
has lost the cheque. But the name of the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A
knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque was drawn.
A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an
offence under this section.
(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of
restoring it to Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence
under this section.
(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers
that it belongs to Z, and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this
section.
(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately
without attempting to discover the owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section.
